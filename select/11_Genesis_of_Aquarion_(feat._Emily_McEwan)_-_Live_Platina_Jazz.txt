I remember sitting with you
Underneath the tree of life
We listened to every fainted cry
Of the creatures there on the day
The world began
Looking at everything I've lost
And almost everythin that I've loved
I'll hold them all tightly in my arms
Wondering where I am, so please tell me
Where to go
All of the answer you seek lie hidden
In the sun
If I hadn't met you my life would've been
In the darkness forever
In my wings are the powers of immortality
But by meeting you my whole life has
Changed
You give light to me, hope to me, strength
Into my life
All this time these twelve thousand years
I know AISHITERU
Eight thousand years from the time that
I met you my love grows stronger than
Before
One hundred million and two thousand
Years from now AISHITERU
I want you to know since you came in my
Life
Every day, every night you give light
Into the darkest skies
All this time these twelve thousand years
I know AISHITERU
Eight thousand years from the time that
I met you my love grows stronger than
Before
One hundred million and two thousand
Years from now AISHITERU
I want you to know since you came in my
Life
Every day, every night you give light
Into the darkest skies
